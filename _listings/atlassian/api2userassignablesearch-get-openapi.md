  title: Jira Cloud API Find users assignable to issues
  description: |-
    Returns a list of users that can be assigned to an issue. Use this method to find the list of users who can be assigned to:

    *   a new issue, by providing the `projectKeyOrId`.
    *   an updated issue, by providing the `issueKey`.
    *   to an issue during a transition (workflow action), by providing the `issueKey` and the transition id in `actionDescriptorId`. You can obtain the IDs of an issue's valid transitions using the `transitions` option in the `expand` parameter of [Get issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-issue-issueIdOrKey-get).

    In all these cases, you can pass a username to determine if a user can be assigned to an issue. The user is returned in the response if they can be assigned to the issue or issue transition. **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ) required:** Permission to access Jira.
