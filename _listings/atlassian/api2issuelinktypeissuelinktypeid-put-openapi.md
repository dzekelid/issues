        Creates an issue or a sub-task from a JSON representation.

        You can provide two parameters in request's body: `update` or `fields`. The fields, that can be set on an issue create operation, can be determined using the **/rest/api/2/issue/createmeta** resource. If a particular field is not configured to appear on the issue's Create screen, then it will not be returned in the createmeta response. A field validation error will occur if such field is submitted in request.

        Creating a sub-task is similar to creating an issue with the following differences:

        *   `issueType` field must be set to a sub-task issue type (use `/issue/createmeta` to find sub-task issue types), and
        *   You must provide a `parent` field with the ID or key of the parent issue.

        Fields will only be returned if `expand=projects.issuetypes.fields` is set.

        Allows to set a property for all issues identified by a given filter. Only entities the user has permissions to edit will be updated.

        Currently the following filters are available:

        *   **entityIds** \- A list of issues to update. Only issues with ids from this list will be considered for updating. This is an optional filter, if not provided, then any editable issue that matches all other filters will be updated.
        *   **currentValue** \- If provided, then only issues with the property currently set to that value will be updated.
        *   **hasProperty** \- If true, then only existing properties will be updated. If false, then only issues that do not have any value associated with this property will be updated. If omitted, the property will be set on all issues, regardless of whether it previously existed or not.

        If more than one filter is given, then they are all joined with the logical "and", that is: only issues that satisfy all filters are updated. If no filters are provided at all, then the property will be updated on _all_ issues editable by the caller (i.e. issues in projects with the EDIT_ISSUES permission).

        If an invalid combination of filters is provided, an error will be returned by the API. For example, specifying the current value and "hasProperty" to "false" would never match any issues (as it would mean: update this property if the current value is something, oh, but only if there is no value at all) and is therefore not allowed.

        This method is [asynchronous](#async), meaning that it will not return the results immediately, instead creating a task to perform the requested update operation (unless preliminary validation, e.g. of the provided filter, fails).

        The operation is transactional: either all eligible issues are updated, or none (if there are any errors).

        Returns a full representation of the issue for the given issue key.

        The issue JSON consists of the issue key and a collection of fields. Additional information like links to workflow transition sub-resources, or HTML rendered values of the fields supporting HTML rendering can be retrieved with `expand` request parameter specified.

        The `fields` request parameter accepts a comma-separated list of fields to include in the response. It can be used to retrieve a subset of fields. By default all fields are returned in the response. A particular field can be excluded from the response if prefixed with a "-" (minus) sign. Parameter can be provided multiple times on a single request.

        By default, all fields are returned in the response. Note: this is different from a JQL search - only navigable fields are returned by default (`*navigable`).

If no crop parameters are specified, the square originates at the top left of the image. The length of the square's sides is set to the smaller of the height or width of the image. The cropped image is then used to create avatars of 16x16, 24x24, 32x32, and 48x48 in size. After creating the avatar, use [Update issue type](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-issuetype-id-put) to set it as the issue type's active avatar. **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ) required:** _Administer Jira_ [global permission](href=).

        ### About permission schemes and grants

        A permission scheme is a collection of permission grants. A permission grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`.

        #### Holder

        The `holder` object contains information about the user or group being granted the permission. For example, the _Administer projects_ permission is granted to a group named _Teams in space administrators_. In this case, the type is `"type": "group"`, and the parameter is the group name, `"parameter": "Teams in space administrators"`. The `holder` object is defined by the following properties:

        *   `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below).
        *   `parameter` The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name.

        The following `types` are available. The expected values for the `parameter` are given in parenthesis (some `types` may not have a `parameter`):

        *   `anyone` Grant for anonymous users.
        *   `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name). See [Manage application access](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/manage-application-access-744721629.html) for more information.
        *   `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue.
        *   `group` Grant for the specified group (group name).
        *   `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).
        *   `projectLead` Grant for a project lead.
        *   `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (project role ID).
        *   `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue.
        *   `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24dKLg) for more information.
        *   `user` Grant for the specified user (user ID).
        *   `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).

        #### Permissions
